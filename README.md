Description: Welcome to the virtual game of Life! Through the console, you will be able to play your way through retirement! Enjoy the good life :)


How to run: Download code and compile Main.java! Interact with the command line and you will be off! 



Patterns implemented within code: 

1. Command - Most of game uses it, this controls the board space events, cards, and other events.
2. Observer - Observes simulation and stores events of each round in a text file.
3. Iterator - Board is a linked list that is iterated over 
4. Singleton - Only allows one logger that exist through eager instantiation.
